Title: Learning Noise Optimization for Reward Alignment in Few-Step Generative Models
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Reward alignment for diffusion- and flow-based generative models is often formulated over stochastic trajectories, making it less suitable for few-step deterministic generators. Initial noise optimization provides a trajectory-free alternative, but existing gradient-free methods require costly per-s

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
