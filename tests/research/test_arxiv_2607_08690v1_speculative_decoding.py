Title: A Practical Investigation of Training-free Relaxed Speculative Decoding
Technique: speculative_decoding
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d41

Abstract excerpt:
  Speculative decoding accelerates sampling from an autoregressive LLM by using a faster auxiliary model to draft tokens which are then verified in parallel by the LLM. Standard speculative decoding is lossless: its rejection and resampling steps exactly preserve the LLM's sampling distribution. Recen

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
