Title: Non-vacuous Generalization Bounds for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is widely used to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the generalizability of the resulting models remains poorly understood. In this work, we establish the first non-vacuous generalization bounds for paramet

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
