Title: LLM-guided Planar Loco-Manipulation for Quadruped Robots
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Robotic navigation typically assumes a collision-free route to the goal exists; in cluttered environments with movable obstacles, however, reaching the goal may require physical interaction. Classical solutions encode these behaviors through geometric rules and task-specific logic, while learning-ba

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
