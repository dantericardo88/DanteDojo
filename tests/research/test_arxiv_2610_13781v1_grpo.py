Title: SimVTA: Simulation-Grounded Video-Trajectory Alignment for Driving World Action Models
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Driving world action models (WAMs) learn from paired trajectories and future observations. Post-training with reinforcement learning allows the policy to explore alternative trajectories and improve planning using driving rewards. However, driving logs contain future videos only for the recorded tra

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
