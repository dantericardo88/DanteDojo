Title: Surprise Alone Learns Lies: Evidence-Gated Continual Learning for LLMs from Streaming Claims
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Continual learning methods for large language models increasingly decide what to learn by surprise, keeping the inputs the model finds least predictable. This rule is unsafe when the stream contains lies. A planted falsehood about something the model knows has low probability under the model's belie

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
