Title: Acceptance-Aware Draft Model Training for Speculative Decoding
Technique: speculative_decoding
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d41

Abstract excerpt:
  Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by using a lightweight draft model to generate multiple candidate tokens that are verified by the target model in a single forward pass. Its speedup is largely determined by the acceptance length, yet existing draft-model training

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
