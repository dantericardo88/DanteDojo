Title: LEMMO: A Large Electromagnetic Model leveraging Pretrained LLMs for Million-Sample Signal Understanding
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Large language models have expanded beyond text to vision, audio, and other modalities, but understanding raw electromagnetic (EM) signals remains challenging. Wideband recordings can contain millions of samples, whereas existing waveform-based EM models are primarily evaluated on short in-phase and

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
