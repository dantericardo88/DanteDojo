Title: MINE: Entropy-coded Memory-efficient Inference for Large Language Models
Technique: vllm
Metric: latency_ms improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d31

Abstract excerpt:
  We present MINE (Memory-efficient INference Engine), a lossless entropy coding approach that accelerates single-stream inference of Large Language Models (LLMs), where existing lossless compression methods yield speedups only for specific data types such as \texttt{BF16} and under additional assumpt

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
