Title: SafeStart: Mitigating the Overlooked Safety Cost of Active Expert Reduction in MoE LLM Serving
Technique: vllm
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d31

Abstract excerpt:
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models send each token through a few of many expert subnetworks. Serving methods make these models faster by running even fewer experts per token, and they are validated on accuracy benchmarks. We show that these methods can weaken the model's refusal of harmful req

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
