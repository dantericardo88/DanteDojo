Title: S2PD: Serial-to-Parallel Diffusion for Physically and Logically Consistent Video Generation
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Bidirectional video diffusion models denoise entire videos in parallel, yet when trained on effectively unlimited in-distribution data from procedural generators, continue to violate physical laws and simple symbolic rules. We introduce Serial-to-Parallel Diffusion (S2PD), which performs autoregress

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
