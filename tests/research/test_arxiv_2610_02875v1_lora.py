Title: Query-aware routing for Cross-lingual performance gains in Encoders
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Multilingual encoders can exhibit reduced retrieval effectiveness when queries and relevant documents differ in language, despite strong same-language performance. We investigate whether Finnish and Swedish cross-lingual retrieval can improve while preserving an encoder's existing same-language perf

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
