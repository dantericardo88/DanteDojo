Title: Every Model Leaves a Trace: Multi-Resolution LLM Fingerprinting
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Large language models leave model-specific traces in their generated text, but it remains unclear how finely these fingerprints can distinguish related models and which signals remain informative as obvious cues are reduced. We study this through fingerprint resolution, considering both model resolu

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
