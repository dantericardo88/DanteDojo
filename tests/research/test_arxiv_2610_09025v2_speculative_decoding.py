Title: SPIN: Shadow Predictive Indexer for Sparse Attention
Technique: speculative_decoding
Metric: tokens_per_sec improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d41

Abstract excerpt:
  Indexer-based sparse attention reduces the cost of core attention by passing only a fixed, small number of important tokens to it. However, the indexer must still score the entire KV cache at every decoding step. This scoring overhead becomes a major bottleneck as the context length grows. We propos

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
