Technique: vllm
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d31

Abstract excerpt:
  We present Flama, an open-source Python framework for developing and deploying production-ready web APIs, machine learning services, and large-language-model (LLM) applications. Built on the Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI), Flama offers a type-driven, async-first programming model that 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
