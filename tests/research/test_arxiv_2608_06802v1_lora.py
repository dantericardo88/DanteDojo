Title: Simple-OPD: Demystifying Warm-up for On-policy Distillation
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  On-policy distillation (OPD) trains a student on its own rollouts with token-level supervision from teacher models, but its effectiveness can depend strongly on the warm-up stage before OPD. In this paper, we demystify warm-up for OPD from both data and training perspectives. For data, we find that 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
