Title: A Probabilistic Interpretation of KV Cache Eviction
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: tokens_per_sec improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  The premise and promise of KV (cache) eviction is simple: higher throughput can be achieved by evicting some entries from the KV cache, at a negligible cost to quality. This holds empirically for many existing methods, though most rely on creative heuristics for selecting which entries to drop. Desp

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
