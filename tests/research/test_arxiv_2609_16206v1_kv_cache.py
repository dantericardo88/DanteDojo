Title: Calibrate, Then Route: A Measured Study of Learned Request Routing for Disaggregated LLM Serving
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: latency_ms improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  Disaggregated LLM serving places compute heavy prefill and memory heavy decode on separate GPU pools. Systems such as DistServe, Splitwise, and Mooncake make this separation fast, but routing still determines which instances handle each request. We study a router that estimates the additional comple

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
