Title: Neuron-Aware Data Selection for Annotation-Free LLM Self-Distillation
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Post-training large language models (LLMs) without real-world interaction feedback or human-labeled supervision remains challenging, particularly in specialized domains where expert annotations are costly to obtain. Recent annotation-free self-evolution methods address this by using the model's own 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
