Title: Temporal Leakage in Financial News NLP: A Multi-Architecture Audit with a Regime-Specific M&A Signal
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Financial-news direction prediction has become a popular NLP benchmark, yet reported gains depend critically on whether the train-test split is chronological or random, i.e., on temporal leakage. We audit this dependence on a 49,799-article corpus across 16 feature-model combinations spanning TF-IDF

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
