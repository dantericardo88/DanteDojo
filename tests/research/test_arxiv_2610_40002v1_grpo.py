Title: How Much Should a VLA Trust Its Reasoning? Step-Level Guidance as a Measured Action-Value Function
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Reasoning vision-language-action (VLA) policies write a reasoning trace and then decode the action from it. A wrong trace yields a wrong action, and even a correct-looking trace can mislead the plan. Existing remedies ask whether the reasoning is right. We ask how strongly it should steer. CoC-CFG a

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
