Title: LEAP: Learned Block-wise Evidence Retrieval for Long Audio-Video Perception
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Hour-scale audio-visual question answering is constrained by a context dilemma: dense whole-recording encoding rapidly exhausts context limits, whereas uniform temporal compression severely dilutes fine-grained acoustic and visual evidence. We introduce LEAP, a framework where the model retrieves it

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
