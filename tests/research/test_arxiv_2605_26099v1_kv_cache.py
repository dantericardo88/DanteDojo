Title: Language Models Need Sleep
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: latency_ms improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  Transformer-based large language models are increasingly used for long-horizon tasks; however, their attention mechanism scales poorly with context length. To handle this, we study a sleep-like consolidation mechanism in which a model periodically converts recent context into persistent fast weights

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
