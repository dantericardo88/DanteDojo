Title: MemT-1.0: Towards Memory-Native Evolution
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  Memory-native evolution requires making memory an intrinsic capability of foundation models, enabling them to continuously accumulate and utilize information. To this end, we introduce MemT-1.0, a new architecture of memory foundation models that internalize memory as part of model computation. Buil

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
