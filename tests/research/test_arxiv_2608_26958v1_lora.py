Title: Scaling Model-Generated Distillation Data Can Make Latent Teacher Traits More Recoverable
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Scaling model-generated data is usually viewed as improving distillation: more examples should increase coverage, reduce noise, and produce stronger students. We show a second effect: larger datasets can make subtle teacher-specific signals easier to detect in the trained student, even when examples

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
