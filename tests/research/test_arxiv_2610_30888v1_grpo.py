Title: Building Presentation Intelligence for High-Quality Slide Generation
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) are a dominant medium for communication across diverse domains, yet high-quality PPT generation still depends heavily on labor-intensive human effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for agentic tasks have created both new opportunities and challenges 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
