Title: EAGLE-360: Embodied Active Global-to-Local Exploration in 360$^\circ$
Technique: rope
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in standard visual understanding, adapting them for active visual search in 360$^\circ$ panoramic environments exposes fundamental limitations. Specifically, standard MLLMs struggle to effectively model inheren

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
