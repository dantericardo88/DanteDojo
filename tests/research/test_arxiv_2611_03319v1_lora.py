Title: TrafficInstruct: A Multi-Task Network Traffic Dataset and Benchmark for Instruction Tuning
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Instruction tuning for multi-task network traffic analysis requires data with clearly defined sources, supervision targets, and evaluation conditions. We introduce TrafficInstruct, a newly collected dataset comprising raw packet captures and 55,000 structured supervised fine-tuning records across te

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
