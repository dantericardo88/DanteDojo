Title: UniPolicy: Unified Objective-Specific Policies for Generative Search Advertising
Technique: lora
Metric: latency_ms improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Search advertising connects user intent with commercial content and plays a critical role in platform monetization. Recent systems typically align pretrained generative models with a single business reward, such as eCPM, or use naive reward fusion for preliminary multi-objective alignment. However, 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
