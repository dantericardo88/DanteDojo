Title: Beyond Capacity: Scalable MoE LLM Inference via High-Bandwidth Flash with Direct GPU and HBM Paths
Technique: moe
Metric: tokens_per_sec improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d41

Abstract excerpt:
  Modern mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models increasingly strain the capacity and cost efficiency of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), as rapidly growing expert weights must be provisioned close to GPUs. High-bandwidth flash (HBF) offers substantially greater capacity, but conventional designs typical

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
