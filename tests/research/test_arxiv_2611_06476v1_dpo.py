Title: The Alignment Tax Is Graded: Task-Selective Capability Loss Under Length-Normalized DPO with SFT Retention
Technique: dpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Setting. This is an empirical characterization study; we propose no new method and run no comparisons against alternative objectives. We fine-tune Qwen3.5-4B with sparse LoRA and length-normalized DPO plus an SFT retention term (the RPO objective) on structured financial-filing tasks, and track down

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
