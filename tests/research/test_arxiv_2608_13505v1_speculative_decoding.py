Title: Intern-S2-Preview: Scientific Agentic Foundation Model
Technique: speculative_decoding
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d41

Abstract excerpt:
  Scientific discovery increasingly requires AI systems that can reason over scientific evidence of heterogeneous modalities, interact with scientific tools and environments, and sustain progress across long task horizons. We present Intern-S2-Preview, a series of scientific agentic foundation models 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
