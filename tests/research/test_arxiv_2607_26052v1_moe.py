Title: Spend Experts Where You Are Unsure: Confidence-Adaptive Routing for Mixture-of-Experts LoRA
Technique: moe
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d41

Abstract excerpt:
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) route every token to a fixed number of experts $k$. Tokens differ in how uncertain the model is about them, so a single k over-spends on easy tokens and under-serves hard ones. We observe that the router's output distribution is already

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
