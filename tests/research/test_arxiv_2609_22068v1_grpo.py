Title: CodeMidas: Scaling Agentic Coding RL Environments from Code Itself
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Training capable coding agents via reinforcement learning (RL) requires diverse tasks with reliable verifiers. Open-source codebases offer a rich source of such tasks, while existing methods typically rely on development artifacts such as issues and commits, limiting the range of tasks that can be e

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
