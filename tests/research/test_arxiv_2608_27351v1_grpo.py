Title: Understanding Evolution Strategies for LLM Reasoning: Broader Reasoning Coverage than GRPO
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Evolution Strategies (ES) have recently emerged as a memory-efficient post-training paradigm for LLM reasoning. However, the optimization behavior of ES remains understudied, making it hard to define its advantage scope compared to mainstream post-training paradigms (e.g., Group Relative Policy Opti

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
