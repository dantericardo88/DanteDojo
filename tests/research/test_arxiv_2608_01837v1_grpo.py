Title: PCSD: Persistent Consistency for Self-Distillation in Agentic Reinforcement Learning
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Large language model agents have shown strong potential in complex interactive tasks, yet their reinforcement learning (RL) is often hindered by sparse rewards, as a long multi-turn trajectory may receive only a single outcome-level signal. On-policy self-distillation (OPSD) provides dense token-lev

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
