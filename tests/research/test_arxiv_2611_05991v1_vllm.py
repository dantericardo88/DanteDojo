Title: A Controlled Experimental Evaluation of Configuration and Cache Architecture in LLM Serving Engines
Technique: vllm
Metric: tokens_per_sec improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d31

Abstract excerpt:
  Multi-agent LLM applications repeat most of their prompt tokens across requests, and serving engines reuse the cached state of shared prefixes. vLLM and SGLang reuse it at different granularities, and benchmarks of their default deployments report large performance gaps, usually credited to the cach

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
