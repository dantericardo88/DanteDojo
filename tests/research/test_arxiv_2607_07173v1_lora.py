Title: Stage-Aware Adaptation and Distribution Calibration for Subject-Driven Personalized Text-to-Image Generation
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Subject-driven personalized text-to-image generation requires a pretrained diffusion model to acquire a specific subject from a few reference images while preserving subject identity, following novel text prompts, and maintaining sample diversity. Existing optimization-based methods instantiate subj

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
