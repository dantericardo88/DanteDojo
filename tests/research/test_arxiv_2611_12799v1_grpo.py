Title: Agentic-OPD: Recovering Forgotten Agent Capabilities via On-Policy Distillation for Agentic Tasks
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Reinforcement learning is now the mainstream paradigm for training LLMs on agentic tasks, yet standard practice keeps only the best-validation checkpoint and discards the rest. We show that this is lossy: in GRPO training of LLM agents, the best-validation checkpoint fails on problems that earlier c

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
