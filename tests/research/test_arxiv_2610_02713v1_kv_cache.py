Title: WakeKV: Reactive, Reversible KV Residency for Heads That Change Their Minds
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: tokens_per_sec improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  Most KV-cache compression methods classify attention heads once, either offline or during prefill, and keep this classification fixed throughout generation. Across three models (1.5B-8B) and three regimes (needle retrieval, long chain-of-thought, and multi-turn recall), we measure head behavior on f

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
