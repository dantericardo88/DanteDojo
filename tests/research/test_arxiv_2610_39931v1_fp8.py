Title: Low-Bit GDN Recurrent-State Quantization: Global Gradient-aware Allocation and Pure-Write Sliding Windows
Technique: fp8
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d10

Abstract excerpt:
  Linear attention stores historical information in a recurrent state of fixed size, providing a compact memory representation for long-context inference. Reducing state precision further lowers per-request storage requirements, but quantized writeback errors enter subsequent recurrences, degrade pred

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
