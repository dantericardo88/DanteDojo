Title: Spexis: Speculative Lookahead Scheduling for LLM Inference
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  Spexis is a multi-GPU LLM inference framework that improves the efficiency of pipeline and tensor parallelism through speculative parallelism. Rather than using speculative decoding only to accelerate token generation, Spexis runs speculation in parallel with normal execution, introducing a new para

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
