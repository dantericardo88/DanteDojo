Title: Projected Distillation: On Learning to Solve Hard Problems from Close, Correct Targets
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  On-policy learning is central to post-training: training on a model's own generations limits distribution shift and helps preserve existing capabilities. On hard problems, however, on-policy RL provides no reward-based learning signal when all attempts fail. On-policy distillation provides next-toke

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
