Title: Co-Evolving Policy and Reward for Code Generation: A Mechanistic Study of Single-Adapter Drift
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is particularly well suited to code generation because generated programs can be objectively evaluated through execution. Execution also provides behavioral information that can be reused as additional supervision. The Synergistic Policy and Rewa

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
