Title: FRAME: Learning the Adaptation Domain with a Mixture of Fractional-Fourier Experts
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) reparameterizes weight updates in a fixed basis: low-rank adapters operate in the spatial domain, while a recent line of spectral methods operates in a fixed Fourier domain. We argue that the choice of domain is itself a design degree of freedom that should be 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
