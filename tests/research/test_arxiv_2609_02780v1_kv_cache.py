Title: ShallowStream: Index Shallow then Answer Deep for Streaming Video Understanding
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: latency_ms improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  Streaming video understanding is a critical capability for real-world applications, including embodied intelligence, autonomous driving, industrial monitoring, surveillance and early warning, and wearable assistants. However, processing continuous video streams with multimodal large language models 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
