Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Massively multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models covering hundreds of languages must maintain robust performance across diverse linguistic and acoustic conditions. However, these models often encounter the curse of multilinguality, where model capacity is diluted across languages. To

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
