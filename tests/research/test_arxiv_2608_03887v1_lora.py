Title: Omega-S: A Functional Resilience Index for LLM Fine-Tuning
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Fine-tuning a large language model on new data degrades what it previously learned. We present Omega-S, a drop-in penalty computed from the weight matrix alone: it needs no previous-task data, no Fisher matrix and no stored copy of the old weights. It is three lines in an existing training loop and 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
