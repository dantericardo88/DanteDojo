Title: What Makes a Medical Checker Trainable? Diagnosing Signal Collapse and Reward Hacking in Checker-Guided RAG for Biomedic
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Medical RAG needs evidence-grounded claims, so plugging a claim-level NLI checker into retrieval-augmented RL is intuitive. \textbf{We find that the checker's \emph{output distribution} during training, not its held-out accuracy, decides whether it provides trainable gradient.} We compare four NLI c

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
