Title: Parameter Exploration for RLVR via Variational Learning
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Exploration has been a focus of reinforcement learning research for a long time. Recently, there has been growing evidence that it is also an important ingredient in LLM reinforcement learning recipes that can significantly impact downstream performance. Many existing methods control exploration in 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
