Title: FedWeave: Rethinking the Unit of Specialization in Heterogeneous Federated MoE-LoRA
Technique: moe
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d41

Abstract excerpt:
  Federated PEFT enables LLMs to collaboratively adapt to decentralized private data without sharing raw examples. However, task heterogeneity across clients can cause cross-task interference and gradient conflicts during aggregation. Federated MoE-LoRA addresses this challenge through specialized LoR

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
