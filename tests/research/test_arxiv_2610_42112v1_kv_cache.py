Title: Subquadratic Attention with a Hierarchical Tree-Structured Indexer
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  The quadratic scaling of attention is a fundamental bottleneck limiting the long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A variety of approaches have attempted to circumvent this, but they either fail to match attention's expressiveness (e.g., sliding-window or linear attention variant

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
