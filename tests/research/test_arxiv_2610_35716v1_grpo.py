Title: Audit Where Hacks Pay: Budgeted Strong-Verifier Audits Against Reward Hacking in GRPO
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards trains on cheap checks, such as unit tests, that a policy can learn to game, while a stronger check is too expensive to run on every rollout. We study how to spend a limited strong-verifier budget in GRPO, separating which weakly passing rollouts to aud

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
