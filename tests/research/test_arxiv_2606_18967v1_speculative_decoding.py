Title: EfficientRollout: System-Aware Self-Speculative Decoding for RL Rollouts
Technique: speculative_decoding
Metric: latency_ms improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d41

Abstract excerpt:
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a representative post-training paradigm for LLMs, enabling strong reasoning and agentic capabilities. However, rollout generation remains a dominant latency bottleneck because autoregressive sampling decodes responses sequentially and a small number of long-tai

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
