Title: GSRQ: Gain-Shape Residual Quantization for Sub-1-bit KV Cache
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows is increasingly constrained by the linear growth of Key-Value (KV) cache memory. Vector Quantization (VQ), particularly Residual Quantization (RQ), is a promising approach for pushing KV cache storage toward the sub-1-bit r

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
