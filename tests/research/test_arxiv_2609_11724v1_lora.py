Title: The Eloquence submission for Task 2 of the Interspeech 2026 MLC-SLM challenge
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  This paper details the Eloquence team's approach to Task 2 of the 2nd MLC-SLM challenge at Interspeech 2026, which involves multilingual Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) across 21 languages. Three approaches are explored. First, we fine-tune Voxtral-Mini-3B via LoRA with cross-lingual data 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
