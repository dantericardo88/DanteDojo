"""AUTO-GENERATED test stub from arXiv:2609.39601v1

Title: GroundingPI: A Grounding Foundation Model towards Physical Intelligence with Visual Primitives
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Precise grounding matters. It specifies which object is the target and where that object is, even in clutter and for tiny objects, and it has to be fast enough for closed-loop control. Yet vision-language-action (VLA) and world-action models (WAMs) take perception from general-purpose vision-languag

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
