Title: Faithfulness Is Not Free: Auditing Offline KV-Cache Quantization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Technique: kv_cache
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d25

Abstract excerpt:
  Retrieval-augmented generation systems can precompute and store key-value caches of retrieved documents to avoid re-encoding context at every query. Quantizing these caches further reduces storage, but no prior work asks whether compression damages faithfulness, whether responses remain grounded in 

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
