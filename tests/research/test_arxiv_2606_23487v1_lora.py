Title: CADRE: Stable, Parameter Efficient Adaptation of Medical Vision Language Models with Bounded Forgetting and Prior Drift
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Medical vision-language models (VLMs) such as BiomedCLIP generalize broadly, but adapting them to a clinical service is as much a safety problem as an accuracy one. Updating a deployed model for a new imaging modality can fail silently in two ways that harm patients: it can forget modalities it alre

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
