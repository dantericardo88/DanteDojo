Title: Alignment Inertia: Auditing the Durability of Training Data Influence Through Policy Override Resistance
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Platform operators increasingly rely on system prompts and fine-tuning to govern model behavior, yet it remains unclear how reliably these interventions override behavior inherited from prior training. We propose Override Success Rate (OSR) and alignment inertia to measure when operator intervention

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
