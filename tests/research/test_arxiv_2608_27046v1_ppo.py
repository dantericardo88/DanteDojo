Title: Performance Foundations of Parallel & Distributed Reasoning Language Models
Technique: ppo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and other RL-style post-training paradigms have been used for aligning large language models (LLMs) with reasoning standards. The resulting recent Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) such as DeepSeek-R1, o3, and Kimi k1.5 show that such RL-style pos

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
