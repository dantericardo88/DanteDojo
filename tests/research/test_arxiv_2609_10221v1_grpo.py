Title: Why Sample What You Can Enumerate? Exact Policy Optimization for Genomic Tool Selection
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  Reinforcement learning over a frozen reasoner has become a common recipe for teaching a policy which external tools to invoke. We show that this recipe becomes structurally mismatched in specialist scientific settings where the complete tool-subset space is enumerable. There, a small set of recurrin

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
