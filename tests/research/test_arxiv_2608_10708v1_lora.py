Title: Self-Geometry: GT-Free and Plug-and-Play Test-Time Adaptation for Geometrically Consistent 3D Vision Foundation Models
Technique: lora
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d17

Abstract excerpt:
  Recent Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) predict depth, camera pose, and pointmap in a single forward pass without per-scene optimization, achieving strong generalization. However, enforcing explicit multi-view geometric consistency, e.g., through bundle adjustment, is computationally costly and is th

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
