"""AUTO-GENERATED test stub from arXiv:2611.12180v1

Title: TS-GEAR: Taobao Shangou GEnerative Ad Retrieval
Technique: grpo
Metric: quality_score improved 10.0% vs baseline on unknown
Dimension(s): d18

Abstract excerpt:
  On-demand delivery platforms such as DoorDash and Uber Eats impose a constraint absent in traditional e-commerce: merchants beyond the user's delivery range are invalid candidates rather than merely low-ranked. Generative retrieval has recently shown strong potential in large-scale retrieval systems

HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED: implement test_claim_validation below.
Replace the `pytest.skip` with real GPU validation code.
